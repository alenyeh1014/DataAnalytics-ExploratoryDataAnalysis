## Dataset

The data consisted of bike station and user information of approximately 192,000 user records. The attributes included the bike station information such as duration time, start and end time, start and end station name, start and end station latitude and longitude, user type, member birth year, member gender, and bike share or not for all trip. In addition, 9,960 data points were removed from the analysis due to inconsistencies or missing information, so around 182,000 data points left for the deeper analysis.


## Summary of Findings

During the exploration, I found that most bike users are male subscribers who do not want to share their bikes during the trip. Although female subscribers who do not want to share bikes for all the trip are significant as well, the gap between them is still  huge that bike company should pay more attentions on the male subscribers based on the result.

Moreover, the average birth year for subscribers and customers is around 1984 but with many outliers. Furthermore, the minimum and maximum birth year are 1900 and 2001 which means the standard deviation is large. In other words, there is no certain type of the users and more surprisingly there are at least one male and female who born in 1900 in this dataset.

In addition, the start and end times (from 8 to 9am and 5 to 6pm) for bike users are generally the same which means bike users usually have a routine schedule. In my personal opinion, I would assume they probably need to work daily. Also, the most popular start and end station names are nearby San Francisco Caltrain Station which supports my assumptions because San Francisco is a prosperous and bustling city in California. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on not only user information but also bike station information because I believe both resources are helpful and important. I start by introducing the bike user backgrounds, the age distributions, start and end times, user directions, and high frequency bike stations. 

By doing so, I found out that more bike users toward northwest and they are adults who need to work daily. Meanwhile, they also like to ride Caltrains before or after their bikings. That is to say, there is a potential business opportunity for bike and Caltrain company because they can corroborate to promote a customized plan for those who usually ride bikes and Caltrains and I believe it would be a great success.
